Plugins:
	FFNx:
		Field-specific sfx overrides
		Braver sfx cache is going to make FFNx sequential/shuffle irrelevant!
	Tolk:
		Faster, configurable tracking speed/frequency
		AD on field entry
		Pan sound indicating whether can move left/right or not (up/down as well?)

	Plugin to respond to keypress on certain screens and pop up extra info. e.g. weapon info in equip screen.

WM:
	Gradient background for sky on world map
	Track steps
	Encounter tables

Background load razor engine - do other templates? Automatically load all of them after any specified
	"priority" templates like MainMenu?

IFKEYON etc not fully working - prob. due to IsJustPressed one-frame check conflicting with field scripts
	not running every frame?

Shops!

Compressed/single file saves

Test on non-hidpi

Field - model lighting looks a bit too bright
	  - player hand pointer is jumpy (due to int coordinates maybe...?)
	  - easy way of debugging/configure Z ranges
	  - background animations in nmkin_1 not working - perhaps palette effects?
	  - Trigger sound effects are just wrong
	  - Jessie's rotation in nmkin_3 far too slow
	  - Maybe two passes for normal/transparent background tiles is wrong - need to do them all in Z order? (see MD8_1)
	  - md8_2 - aeris' animations seem to restart badly?
	  - Wedge gets stuck in md8_4
	  - Music volume is sticking at zero some point around md8_1/2/4
	  - md8brgd - dialog auto closes too soon, incorrectly? After movie see old location incorrectly before switching field
	  - mds7_pb1 - Marlene's ladder command treats her as a player incorrectly
	  - Tutorials don't actually display
	  - mds7_w2 has multiple KAWAI opcodes to implement!

Music looping works but still a noticeable break at the loop point

Audio global volume sometimes seem to be zero on startup until the next music playback
	-NAudio doing something to reset it?

Same with audio sfx looping!
	Loop detect not quite right - bomb setup sfx in nmkin_5 loop but shouldn't?

Item menu: Icons, actually do arrange

Field Fade network msg, movie msg

Field walkmesh sliding still pretty hacky
	Should it operate only on integer coordinates?
	Presumably that might be how the original game worked...

Battle
	EXP/AP, Gil/items screens need finishing - actually update savedata as well!!!
	Implement alternate music options
	Targetting input is probably wrong - switch always, or based on camera angle...?
	Don't allow targetting dead enemies
	Animations?!?!?!?!?!
	Hit effects...
	Run away!
	Actions that shouldn't do anything still register a miss or 1pt of damage - see Guard Scorpion in battle 324
