WM:
	Gradient background for sky on world map
	Track steps
	Encounter tables

Background load razor engine - do other templates? Automatically load all of them after any specified
	"priority" templates like MainMenu?

IFKEYON etc not fully working - prob. due to IsJustPressed one-frame check conflicting with field scripts
	not running every frame?

Shops!

Compressed/single file saves

Music looping

Item menu: Icons, actually do arrange

Field Fade network msg, movie msg

Field walkmesh sliding still pretty hacky
	Should it operate only on integer coordinates?
	Presumably that might be how the original game worked...
