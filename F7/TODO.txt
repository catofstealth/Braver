WM:
	Gradient background for sky on world map
	Track steps
	Encounter tables

Background load razor engine - do other templates? Automatically load all of them after any specified
	"priority" templates like MainMenu?

IFKEYON etc not fully working - prob. due to IsJustPressed one-frame check conflicting with field scripts
	not running every frame?

Shops!

Compressed/single file saves

Field - camera in movies
	  - model lighting

Music looping works but still a noticeable break at the loop point

Item menu: Icons, actually do arrange

Field Fade network msg, movie msg

Field walkmesh sliding still pretty hacky
	Should it operate only on integer coordinates?
	Presumably that might be how the original game worked...

Battle
	EXP/AP, Gil/items screens need finishing - actually update savedata as well!!!
	Implement alternate music options
	Targetting input is probably wrong - switch always, or based on camera angle...?
	Animations?!?!?!?!?!
	Hit effects...
